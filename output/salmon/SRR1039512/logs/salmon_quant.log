[2019-11-11 11:20:47.894] [jointLog] [info] Computed 6 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-11-11 11:20:47.894] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-11-11 11:20:47.898] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00202376% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 29.


[2019-11-11 11:20:47.899] [jointLog] [warning] Only 11 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
