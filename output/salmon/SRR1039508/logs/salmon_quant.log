[2019-11-11 11:20:50.576] [jointLog] [info] Computed 33 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-11-11 11:20:50.576] [jointLog] [info] Counted 221 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-11-11 11:20:50.580] [jointLog] [warning] Only 221 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
