[2019-11-11 11:20:51.927] [jointLog] [info] Computed 33 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-11-11 11:20:51.927] [jointLog] [info] Counted 349 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-11-11 11:20:51.929] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0064433% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 28.


[2019-11-11 11:20:51.930] [jointLog] [warning] Only 349 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
